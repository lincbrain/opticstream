# Troubleshooting

This page collects common issues encountered when running OpticStream flows and
suggested ways to diagnose them.

## Block load errors

Symptoms:

- `LSMScanConfig.load(...)` or `PSOCTScanConfig.load(...)` fails
- setup/watch commands fail immediately with missing block messages

Checks:

- run `opticstream lsm setup PROJECT_NAME` or `opticstream oct setup PROJECT_NAME`
- verify block names follow project naming conventions used by setup commands

## Disable Slack notifications

In the Prefect UI, create or edit the variable `slack-notifications-enabled`.
Set its value to the JSON boolean `false` (without quotes) to skip OpticStream
Slack failure hooks, messages, and file uploads before any Slack blocks are loaded.
Set it to `true` to enable notifications again. If absent, notifications are enabled.
The setting applies to OCT and LSM jobs using the same Prefect server.

The switch is read on each notification attempt, so subsequent changes do not
require restarting watchers. Restart existing watchers/workers once after installing
the code that supports this switch. Processing and its failure states are unaffected;
disabled notification tasks return normally without sending anything.

## State lock or state backend issues

Symptoms:

- flows hang while opening state contexts (`open_*`)
- state updates fail with lock/backing-store errors

Checks:

- ensure project lock exists (`opticstream lsm create-lock PROJECT_NAME` or
  `opticstream oct create-lock PROJECT_NAME`)
- verify PostgreSQL connector block used by the state repository is accessible
- confirm the state table exists (`project_state` by default)

## File discovery and permission issues

Symptoms:

- watcher runs but detects nothing
- watcher logs unreadable paths or stability never reached

Checks:

- verify watch root exists and is readable by the running user
- confirm expected file/folder patterns are present:
  - LSM: immediate `Run*` subfolders
  - OCT: spectral files matching watcher expectations
- tune `--stability-seconds` and `--poll-interval` to acquisition behavior

## MATLAB / PS-OCT processing failures

Symptoms:

- batch or slice processing fails during MATLAB invocation
- processed outputs are missing after dispatch

Checks:

- verify `matlab_root` and processing params in `PSOCTScanConfig`
- verify psoct-toolbox dependency is installed and importable
- check upstream spectral inputs and batch completeness

## Output validation and size issues

Symptoms:

- generated zarr/volume outputs are unexpectedly small or absent
- channel volume validation fails

Checks:

- verify `output_path`, naming formats, and write permissions
- inspect `zarr_config` and `channel_volume_zarr_size_threshold`
- if using placeholder volume outputs, ensure
  `skip_channel_volume_zarr_validation` is configured as intended

## Upload and external service failures

Symptoms:

- DANDI/LINC upload tasks fail
- authentication/authorization errors in upload flows

Checks:

- verify API token blocks (`dandi-api-key`, `linc-api-key`) are present
- verify configured `dandi_instance` and destination paths
- re-run with verbose Prefect logs to isolate network vs auth failures
